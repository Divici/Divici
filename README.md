# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm David

A Full-Stack Developer born in London and based in Washington DC. As an artist, I have a serious passion for creating clean and creative, dynamic user experiences. 
I recently attended Bloom Tech to further develop my skills and collaborate with like-minded individuals, and look forward to doing the same in the future. <br><br>
My current goals are to help clients build professional and interactive websites, gain more experience, and build strong partnerships within the field.
